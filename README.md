# faran-watches
A responsive, static web page to keep track of the books I've read and the movies and TV shows I've watched and some other info as well.

## Main tech used
The app uses following technologies:
+ [Vue.js 3.2.13](https://vuejs.org/)
+ [Bootstrap 5.2.3](https://getbootstrap.com/)
+ [Sass 1.32.7](https://sass-lang.com/)
+ [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)
+ [ky 0.33.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ky)
+ [Font Awesome 6](https://fontawesome.com/)

The data in stored on contentful and retrieved using the contentful api which I think is super cool.
