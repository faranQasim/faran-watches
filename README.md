# faran-watches
A responsive, static web page to keep track of the books I've read and the movies and TV shows I've watched and some other info as well. The cool thing about this project is that most of the styling and all animations are native.

## Main tech used
The app uses following technologies:
+ [Vue.js 3.2.13](https://vuejs.org/)
+ [Bootstrap 5.2.3](https://getbootstrap.com/)
+ [Sass 1.32.7](https://sass-lang.com/)
+ [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)
+ [ky 0.33.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ky)
+ [Font Awesome 6](https://fontawesome.com/)

The data in stored on contentful and retrieved using the contentful api which I think is super cool.
